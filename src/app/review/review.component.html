            <p>"Mickey 17 presents an intriguing sci-fi concept and raises interesting questions, even if it doesn't
                always explore them with the desired depth.</p>
            <p>Bong Joon-ho continues to demonstrate his mastery in blending genres, but here, the satire and lack of
                subtlety in the narrative end up limiting the emotional and philosophical impact of a story centered on
                sociopolitical themes like identity, technology, and colonialism.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, with a star-studded cast led by an excellent Robert Pattinson and a captivating audiovisual
                style, the South Korean filmmaker reinforces his status as one of the most creative directors working
                today, delivering an experience that falls somewhere between fascinatingly hilarious and frustratingly
                superficial."</p>
